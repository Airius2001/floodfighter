              Floods can separate families or cut off communication. A clear family

              <li>Identify the safest evacuation routes to higher ground.</li>
              <li>

                neighborhood.

              <li>
                Save emergency contacts in all family members‚Äô phones and write
                them on paper too.
              </li>
              <li>
                Decide how to care for pets and elderly family members during an
                evacuation.
              </li>
              <li>Learn how to turn off gas, electricity, and water safely.</li>
              <li>
                Practice the evacuation drill regularly ‚Äî especially with children.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
